evaluating landslide hazards along roads

While landslide hazards vary spatially along roads, information on these is not an inherent property or feature of currently available road data. This makes it difficult to appreciate the information from the perspective of a road user and/or manager.

Using Python, I append Project NOAH landslide hazard data into OSM road network data for a given province in the Philippines; generate a road map with location-specific landslide hazard ratings; and compute relevant statistics for the roads in the output map.

This work highlights the potential of open data and FOSS in maximizing the use of existing information for specific use cases.
